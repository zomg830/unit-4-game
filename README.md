# unit-4-game - Star Wars RPG

## Introduction
* This assignment was meant to test our understanding of jQuery. As such, all game mechanics have been designed utilizing as much jQuery and JavaScript as possible.

## How to play

* When the game starts, select your character by clicking on one of the available character portraits. You will use this character to battle the other heroes available in the game.

* After your character has been chosen, select an opponent to battle. Click the attack button to begin combat. 

* Every character has an HP and an AP (attack power) attribute. Your chosen character will increase in AP as the game progresses. The opposing character(s) has a fixed AP value throughout the course of the game. 

* Upon defeating an enemy select another enemy from the pool to battle. If you defeat all remaining characters, you win the game! If you are defeated in battle, you must restart the game and begin the character selection process again.
